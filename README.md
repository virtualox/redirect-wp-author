## Frequently Asked Questions

**Where can I find the plugin's configuration settings?**

You can configure the plugin under 'Settings > Redirect WP Author'. Here you can choose between 301 (permanent) or 302 (temporary) redirects.

**Why should I redirect author pages?**

Redirecting author pages can improve security by making it harder for attackers to enumerate users on your WordPress site. It also gives you more control over the content architecture of your site.

**How does this affect SEO?**

By default, the plugin uses 301 (permanent) redirects, which is the SEO-friendly way to redirect pages. Search engines will update their index to remove author pages and consolidate any authority to your homepage.
